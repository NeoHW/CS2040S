Relevant for CS2040 midterms:
- CS2040 18/19 Semester 2: 2,6-10,12
- CS2040 17/18 Special Term 2: A1-7,B1-3,F2
- CS2040 19/20 Special Term 2: 1-3,5

For all the code-related questions, just try to think of the pseudocode, no need to write actual code on midterms.
Also, ignore the bloom filter questions as it is outside the scope of CS2040 (only for CS2040S).
Other than that, everything :)
